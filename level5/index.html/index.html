<b>In programing we have different languages for exaple:C++; Java; Javascript; Python and Perl. </b>
<h3>what is C++</h3>
<img src="./imiges/ISO_C++_Logo.svg.png" alt="" width="10%">
<p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language</p>
<p>created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
<p>First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language,</p>
<p> it has since expanded significantly over time.</p>
<P>C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, </P>
<p>resource-constrained software and large systems in mind,</p>
<p>with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.</p>
<h3>what is Java</h3>
<img src="./imiges/Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png" alt="">
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming</p>
<p>language that is designed to have as few implementation</p>
<p>dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended</p>
<p>to let programmers write once, run anywhere</p>
<p>(WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
<h3>what is Javascript</h3>
<img src="./imiges/Javascript.png" alt="" width="10%">
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web,</p>
<p>alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. </p>
<p>Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. </p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<img src="./imiges/ppppp.jfif" alt="">
<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes</p>
<p>code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. </p>
<p>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. </p>
<h3>Perl</h3>
<img src="./imiges/Perl.svg" alt="" width="15%">
<p>Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.</p>
<p>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various </p>
<p>backronyms in use, including "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language". </p>
<p>Perl. Frequently referred to as “the Swiss army knife” of scripting, </p>
<p>Perl has been around for almost 4 decades and it's still going strong.</p>
